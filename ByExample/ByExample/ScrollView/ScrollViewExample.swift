import SwiftUI

/// https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/scrollview
/// A view that provides a scrolling interface to navigate through a set of content.
///
/// In SwiftUI, the `ScrollView` allows content that exceeds the bounds of the screen
/// or its container to be accessible by scrolling. It can operate both vertically and
/// horizontally. The content inside a `ScrollView` is laid out once and does not change,
/// even if the content is scrolled out of view.
///
/// In this example, we present a vertical `ScrollView` containing a list of colored rectangles.
/// This demonstrates how content can extend beyond the visible frame, requiring the user to
/// scroll to see the entirety of the content.

struct ScrollViewExample: View {
    /// Colors for demonstration purposes
    let colors: [Color] = [.red, .green, .blue, .orange, .pink, .purple, .yellow, .gray]

    /// The main view content which is rendered and displayed on the screen
    var body: some View {
        /// A vertical ScrollView.
        ScrollView(.vertical, showsIndicators: true) {
            /// A VStack containing colored rectangles.
            VStack(spacing: 20) {
                ForEach(colors, id: \.self) { color in
                    Rectangle()
                        .fill(color)
                        .frame(height: 200)
                        .cornerRadius(15)
                }
            }
