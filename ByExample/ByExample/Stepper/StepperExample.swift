import SwiftUI

/// https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/stepper
/// A user interface control that provides an intuitive way to adjust
/// a numerical value, typically within a predefined range.
///
/// In SwiftUI, the `Stepper` view allows users to increment or decrement
/// a value by tapping on the plus or minus buttons. It can work directly
/// with a binding to a value, ensuring the value changes as the stepper is adjusted.
/// Additionally, it can be combined with text or other views to describe its purpose.
///
/// In this example, we present a `Stepper` that lets users adjust the quantity
/// of an item. The current quantity is displayed next to the stepper.
///
/// Additional reference: How to create a stepper and read values from it
/// https://www.hackingwithswift.com/quick-start/swiftui/how-to-create-a-stepper-and-read-values-from-it
